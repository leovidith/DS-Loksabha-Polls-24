## Requirements

To run this script, you will need Python and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash

## Data Description

The script reads election results from a CSV file named `election_results_2024.csv`. The expected columns in the CSV file include:
- `Leading Party`
- `Trailing Party`
- `Leading Candidate`
- `Margin`
- `Constituency`

## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Load Data**: Reads the CSV file containing the election results.
2. **Margin and Seat Counts**: Calculates and visualizes the total margin of victory and the number of constituencies won by each party.
3. **Candidate Comparison**: Compares votes for key candidates (Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah) across constituencies.
4. **NDA vs. INDI Parties**: Separates and visualizes the number of constituencies won by NDA and INDI parties.
5. **Margin of Victory**: Provides various visualizations of the margin of victory, including bar plots, histograms, and box plots.
6. **Trailing Parties**: Analyzes and visualizes the top 10 trailing parties by votes and seats.

## Visualizations

The script generates the following visualizations:
- **Bar Plot**: Number of constituencies won by each party.
- **Comparison Bar Plot**: Votes comparison among Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, and Amit Shah.
- **NDA vs. INDI Parties**: Bar plots showing the number of constituencies won by NDA and INDI parties.
- **Margin of Victory**:
  - Bar plot for top and bottom margins of victory.
  - Histogram of the margin distribution.
  - Box plot of margins by party.
- **Trailing Parties**: Bar plots for the top 10 trailing parties by votes and seats.

## Usage

1. Place the `election_results_2024.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using a Python environment that has the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   python election_results_analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will generate various plots and visualizations based on the election data.
